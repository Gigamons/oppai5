# oppai5 (oppai-go)

osu! pp and difficulty calculator. Transpiled by hand version of https://github.com/Francesco149/koohii

I tried first to use cgo to use oppai-ng in Go but it was giving me always a 'undefined reference to c_function' error from the linker.
Recently [Francesco149](https://github.com/Francesco149) made a version in Java easy to understand and very easy to convert 1:1 to Go.
